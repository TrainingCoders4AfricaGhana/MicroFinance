MicroFinance
============

As a Microfinance organization, our basic need of technology stems back into data management, correlating with real time information dissemination between our team here in Accra and locations overseas.Last year we signed up with a service provider called Mambu.com. This outlet helped us
complete our day to day and results established same time, but now, the service is provided at a cost
unsustainable to us. Secondly, we also have an in house software, performing some of mambu's
function, but not to the standard expected, therefore I would appreciate if Coders4africa can visit with
us, investigate, and have their questions answered in the bid to help us come up with a system mirroring
Mambu's. The whole idea behind this is to migrate from the labor intensive and time consuming excel
spreadsheet management of our data, to a more functional software (hopefully cloud base) provision, to
promote efficiency within KINGSBRIDGE.
